## Project Overview

Manage and fix a WordPress/WooCommerce catalog of Bremont luxury watches to match official specifications, ensuring all products follow Palladio Jewellers naming conventions as Official Bremont Retailer.

### Key Requirements

- 8 products missing entirely

### Cleanup Playbook Executed

#### Step 1: Delete 10 Duplicate Products
```javascript
const PRODUCTS_TO_DELETE = [
  28640, // Duplicate: Supermarine 300, Blue (older version)
  28638, // Duplicate: Supermarine S300 Bracelet (older version)
  28681, // Duplicate: Supermarine S300M Date, Rubber (older version)
  28636, // Duplicate: Supermarine S300M Date, Blue (older version)
  28679, // Stray duplicate with missing data
  28634, // Duplicate: Supermarine 300m, Green Rubber (older version)
  28670, // Duplicate: Terra Nova 40.5 Date, Green (older version)
  28668, // Duplicate: Terra Nova Chronograph Green (older version)
  28666, // Duplicate: Terra Nova 42.5 Chronograph, Black (older version)

];
```

#### Step 2: Fix 9 Products
Corrected reference numbers, titles, and slugs for products including:
- Terra Nova Power Reserve models

## Scripts Created

- Removes SKUs from all products (per user request)
- Uploads images for 8 new products with proper metadata

- Pattern: `<p><strong>Product Name</strong></p>`

### 4. add-bremont-brand-field.js

### 5. fix-meter-capitalization.js

- Only modifies product titles, not descriptions

### 6. update-missing-descriptions.js

### Common Patterns Used

#### API Authentication
```javascript
const { WP_USER, APP_PASSWORD, WP_URL } = process.env;

auth: {
  username: WP_USER,
  password: APP_PASSWORD
}
```

#### Image Upload with Metadata
```javascript
const form = new FormData();
form.append('file', imageBuffer, fileName);
form.append('alt_text', altText);
form.append('title', title);
form.append('caption', `Palladio Jewellers - Official Bremont Retailer - Vancouver - ${title}`);
form.append('description', `${title} image at Palladio Jewellers, Official Bremont Retailer in Vancouver.`);
```

#### Hidden Reference Tags
```html
<span style="display: none;">Tags : Ref No: [REFERENCE-NUMBER]</span>
```

- User provided detailed playbook
- Executed cleanup: deleted 10, fixed 9, created 8 products

### Phase 5: Final Corrections

## Key Learnings and Patterns

### 1. WordPress/WooCommerce Best Practices
- Always fetch current data before updates
- Use meta_data array for custom fields
- Handle both key variations ('brand' and 'Brand')
- Include proper error handling and rate limiting

### 2. Image Management
- Use FormData for multipart uploads
- Include comprehensive metadata (title, alt, caption, description)
- Follow naming conventions for SEO

### 3. Product Data Structure
- Reference numbers in hidden spans for tracking
- Consistent title formatting
- Complete technical specifications
- Proper collection categorization

### 4. User Communication
- User requirements may evolve (SKU example)
- Always confirm understanding before major changes
- Document all changes for future reference

## Next Steps (If Needed)

The Bremont catalog is now fully configured and matches all specifications. If you need to continue this work:

1. All scripts are in `/workspace/` directory
2. Reference documents are available
3. This documentation captures the complete state
4. Environment variables needed: WP_USER, APP_PASSWORD, WP_URL

## Final Notes

This project successfully transformed a disorganized catalog of 31 products into a clean, properly formatted catalog of exactly 29 products, matching all official Bremont specifications and Palladio Jewellers requirements.

All requested tasks have been completed, and the catalog is ready for production use.
