# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since GitHub CLI authentication isn't available in this environment, please follow these steps to create the repository and push the code:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository" or go to https://github.com/new
3. Repository details:
   - **Name**: `wp-rolex-banner-uploader`
   - **Description**: `Autonomous WordPress Image Upload Script for Rolex Banners at Palladio Jewellers - AI-powered metadata generation with intelligent file detection`
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if preferred)
   - **Initialize**: Don't initialize with README (we have existing code)

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push
Run these commands in your local project directory:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wp-rolex-banner-uploader.git

# Push the feature branch
git push -u origin claude/session-20250612-052150

# Create and push main branch
git checkout main || git checkout -b main
git merge claude/session-20250612-052150
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Create Release (Optional)

git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release - Complete WordPress Rolex banner upload system"
git push origin v1.0.0
