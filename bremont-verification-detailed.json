At its heart lies the chronometer-certified BC781 automatic movement, offering a 62-hour power reserve, quick-set date, hacking seconds, and an independently adjustable GMT hand for tracking a second time zone.</p>\n<p>For added resilience, the movement is suspended within a flexible rubber mount to absorb shocks and reduce impact. The open case back reveals intricate movement finishing in gunmetal grey with Geneva Stripes—while maintaining anti-magnetic protection through a soft iron inner shield based on Faraday cage technology.</p>\n<p>Inspired by cockpit instrumentation, the dial features applied Super-LumiNova® numerals and markers for optimal visibility, along with recessed chronograph subdials. A red-tipped GMT hand sweeps across a 24-hour day/night scale, and the rotating seconds subdial at 9 o’clock is cleverly styled as a tri-blade propeller—an homage to Bremont’s military design roots.</p>\n<p>Completing the timepiece is a newly developed 904L stainless steel bracelet with a brushed finish.

        "fullDescription": "<p><strong>Bremont Altitude Chronograph GMT - Precision Meets Purpose</strong><br />\nThe Altitude Chronograph GMT represents the pinnacle of Bremont’s aviation heritage—a fusion of the proven durability of the MB series with the enhanced functionality of a chronograph and GMT complication. This is a professional-grade timepiece engineered for those who demand precision, resilience, and elegance in one exceptional tool.</p>\n<p>Encased in a 42mm Trip-Tick® case constructed from ultra-durable 904L stainless steel, with a black DLC-coated centre barrel, the Altitude Chronograph GMT is built to perform under extreme conditions. At its core beats the chronometer-rated BC781 automatic movement, delivering an impressive 62-hour power reserve along with a quick-set date, hacking seconds, and an independently adjustable GMT hand.</p>\n<p>Engineered for endurance, the movement is suspended within a flexible rubberised mount that absorbs shocks and minimises impact. An open case back showcases the beautifully finished movement in gunmetal grey with Geneva stripes, while maintaining anti-magnetic protection through an integrated soft iron Faraday cage.</p>\n<p>The cockpit-inspired dial is designed for clarity and function, featuring applied Super-LumiNova® numerals and markers, recessed chronograph subdials, and a red-tipped GMT hand that tracks a second time zone on a 24-hour day/night scale. A rotating propeller-style seconds subdial at 9 o’clock offers a subtle tribute to Bremont’s aeronautical roots.</p>\n<p>Completing the design is Bremont’s newly introduced brushed 904L stainless steel bracelet, engineered for flexibility and comfort. With quick-release curved bars, it offers seamless articulation and an effortless fit.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Altitude Chronograph GMT</strong>—where precision engineering meets elevated style.</p>\n<p><b>Functions</b></p>\n<p>Central GMT/Hour/Minute</p>\n<p>Chronograph centre sweep seconds hand</p>\n<p>Small seconds counter at 9 O'clock</p>\n<p>Chronograph small counters with 30 minutes counter at 12 O'clock and 12 Hour counter at 6 O'clock</p>\n<p>Date at 6 O'clock</p>\n<p><b>Movement</b></p>\n<p>Calibre: BC781AC movement</p>\n<p>No of Jewels: 25 Jewels</p>\n<p>Glucydur balance wheel</p>\n<p>Anachron balance spring</p>\n<p>Nivaflex mainspring</p>\n<p>Frequency: 28,800bph (4Hz)</p>\n<p>Power reserve: 62-hour</p>\n<p>Decorated Bremont rotor</p>\n<p><b>Case specifications</b></p>\n<p>Satin &amp; polished 904L stainless steel Trip-Tick case construction with Brushed Black DLC barrel</p>\n<p>Inner anti-magnetic movement protection ring</p>\n<p>Protective anti-shock movement mount</p>\n<p>Case Diameter: 42mm</p>\n<p>Case Length: 49.62mm</p>\n<p>Case Depth: 14.7mm</p>\n<p>Lug width: 22mm</p>\n<p>Case back: Decorated 904L stainless steel open case back</p>\n<p><b>Dial and Hands specifications</b></p>\n<p>Brushed Black Galvanic metal dial including: Numerals and Indexes filled with white Super-LumiNova® (Blue emission)</p>\n<p>Grey and Black Day and Night 24 hour dial ring</p>\n<p>Brushed sub-dial at 9 O'clock, 12 and 6 O'clock Sub-dials with fine CD Lines</p>\n<p>Gloss Black Hour and Minute hands, filled with white Super-LumiNova® (Blue emission)</p>\n<p>Gloss white chronograph sweeping seconds hand</p>\n<p>Red tipped GMT hand, filled with white Super-LumiNova® (Blue emission)</p>\n<p>Gloss White 12 and 6 O'clock sub dial hands</p>\n<p>Gloss black Propeller design Running Seconds hand at 9 O'clock with white Super-LumiNova® tips</p>\n<p><b>Crystal</b></p>\n<p>Class Box anti-reflective sapphire crystal</p>\n<p><b>Water Resistance</b></p>\n<p>10 ATM, 100 metres</p>\n<p><strong>Strap</strong></p>\n<p>Quick release 904L stainless steel bracelet</p>\n<p><b>Weight</b></p>\n<p>88.8g (watch head only)</p>\n<p><b>Rating &amp; Certification</b></p>\n<p>Chronometer rated to ISO 3159 standard</p>\n<p><span style=\"display: none\">Tags : Ref No: ALT42-CHR-G-SS-BK-B</span></p>\n"

Purpose-built for extreme performance and tested by Bremont ambassador and former Royal Marine Aldo Kane, this high-performance timepiece is engineered to thrive in the world’s most demanding environments.</p>\n<p>Encased in a mono-block black ceramic case—a first for Bremont—this striking 500m diver combines technical excellence with cutting-edge materials. The ceramic is meticulously crafted: soft ceramic powder is shaped, then sintered at 1,450°C under high pressure, shrinking the case by 23% to achieve ultimate hardness and a flawless matte sandblasted finish. The result is an incredibly scratch-resistant and robust watch case, ideal for land, sea, or beyond.</p>\n<p>The design features a PVD-treated titanium uni-directional knurled bezel with a black ceramic insert, complemented by a titanium movement container and PVD titanium case back. Inside, a chronometer-rated automatic movement delivers a 50-hour power reserve, protected and precise under pressure. With 500m water resistance and a helium escape valve, this timepiece is built to dive deep while maintaining its impeccable performance.</p>\n<p>For low-light readability, the applied indexes and hands are filled with blue-emission Super-LumiNova®, offering outstanding visibility and a touch of luminescent brilliance.</p>\n<p>Completing the watch is a black and grey woven fabric NATO-style strap, expertly woven on 18th-century Jacquard French looms. Its self-gripping fastening provides a secure and comfortable fit, ready for any adventure.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Bremont Supermarine Full Ceramic Tactical Black</strong> is where elite engineering meets modern style—crafted for those who demand reliability, resilience, and refinement in every moment.</p>\n<p><b>Functions</b></p>\n<p>Central Hour/Minute/Second</p>\n<p>Date at 3 O'clock</p>\n<p>Unidirectional rotating bezel</p>\n<p><b>Movement</b></p>\n<p>Calibre: Modified Calibre 11 1/2’’’ BE-92AV</p>\n<p>No of Jewels: 25 Jewels</p>\n<p>Glucydur balance wheel</p>\n<p>Anachron balance spring</p>\n<p>Nivaflex mainspring</p>\n<p>Frequency: 28,800bph (4Hz)</p>\n<p>Power reserve: 50-hour</p>\n<p><b>Case specifications</b></p>\n<p>Black ceramic and titanium case construction, black ceramic bezel insert inside a knurled detail PVD treated titanium bezel, automatic helium escape valve and crown protector</p>\n<p>Screw down PVD treated titanium crown</p>\n<p>Case Diameter: 43mm</p>\n<p>Case Length: 50mm</p>\n<p>Case Depth:13mm</p>\n<p>Lug Width: 22mm</p>\n<p>Case back: PVD black titanium screw-in and decorated closed case back</p>\n<p><b>Dial and Hands specifications</b></p>\n<p>Black gradient dial with applied indexes infilled with white Super-LumiNova® (Blue emission)</p>\n<p>Black dial ring with printed minutes track</p>\n<p>Polished black gold hour, minute and second hands filled with white Super-LumiNova® (Blue emission)</p>\n<p>Date window at 3-hour position</p>\n<p><b>Crystal</b></p>\n<p>Domed anti-reflective, scratch resistant sapphire crystal</p>\n<p><b>Water Resistance</b></p>\n<p>50 ATM, 500 metres</p>\n<p><strong>Strap</strong></p>\n<p>Black and grey woven fabric NATO strap with self-gripping fastening system</p>\n<p><b>Weight</b></p>\n<p>74g (watch head only)</p>\n<p><span style=\"display: none\">Tags : Ref No: SM43-DT-BKCER-BK-N-S</span></p>\n"
