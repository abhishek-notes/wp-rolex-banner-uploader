Introducing the next evolution in Bremont’s dive watch legacy: the Supermarine Full Ceramic Tactical Black. Purpose-built for extreme performance and tested by Bremont ambassador and former Royal Marine Aldo Kane, this high-performance timepiece is engineered to thrive in the world’s most demanding environments.

Encased in a mono-block black ceramic case—a first for Bremont—this striking 500m diver combines technical excellence with cutting-edge materials. The ceramic is meticulously crafted: soft ceramic powder is shaped, then sintered at 1,450°C under high pressure, shrinking the case by 23% to achieve ultimate hardness and a flawless matte sandblasted finish. The result is an incredibly scratch-resistant and robust watch case, ideal for land, sea, or beyond.

The design features a PVD-treated titanium uni-directional knurled bezel with a black ceramic insert, complemented by a titanium movement container and PVD titanium case back. Inside, a chronometer-rated automatic movement delivers a 50-hour power reserve, protected and precise under pressure. With 500m water resistance and a helium escape valve, this timepiece is built to dive deep while maintaining its impeccable performance.

For low-light readability, the applied indexes and hands are filled with blue-emission Super-LumiNova®, offering outstanding visibility and a touch of luminescent brilliance.

Completing the watch is a black and grey woven fabric NATO-style strap, expertly woven on 18th-century Jacquard French looms. Its self-gripping fastening provides a secure and comfortable fit, ready for any adventure.

The <strong>Bremont Supermarine Full Ceramic Tactical Black</strong> is where elite engineering meets modern style—crafted for those who demand reliability, resilience, and refinement in every moment.

This is a professional-grade timepiece engineered for those who demand precision, resilience, and elegance in one exceptional tool.

Encased in a 42mm Trip-Tick® case constructed from ultra-durable 904L stainless steel, with a black DLC-coated centre barrel, the Altitude Chronograph GMT is built to perform under extreme conditions.

The cockpit-inspired dial is designed for clarity and function, featuring applied Super-LumiNova® numerals and markers, recessed chronograph subdials, and a red-tipped GMT hand that tracks a second time zone on a 24-hour day/night scale. A rotating propeller-style seconds subdial at 9 o’clock offers a subtle tribute to Bremont’s aeronautical roots.

      <strong>Bremont Altitude Chronograph GMT- A Masterclass in Aviation Timekeeping</strong>

The Altitude Chronograph GMT marks the next evolution in Bremont’s aviation watchmaking — combining the exceptional durability of the MB series with the versatile functionality of both a chronograph and GMT complication.

Encased in a 42mm Trip-Tick® case crafted from ultra-tough 904L stainless steel and finished with a black DLC-coated centre barrel, this timepiece is engineered to perform under the most demanding conditions. At its heart lies the chronometer-certified BC781 automatic movement, offering a 62-hour power reserve, quick-set date, hacking seconds, and an independently adjustable GMT hand for tracking a second time zone.

For added resilience, the movement is suspended within a flexible rubber mount to absorb shocks and reduce impact. The open case back reveals intricate movement finishing in gunmetal grey with Geneva Stripes—while maintaining anti-magnetic protection through a soft iron inner shield based on Faraday cage technology.

Inspired by cockpit instrumentation, the dial features applied Super-LumiNova® numerals and markers for optimal visibility, along with recessed chronograph subdials. A red-tipped GMT hand sweeps across a 24-hour day/night scale, and the rotating seconds subdial at 9 o’clock is cleverly styled as a tri-blade propeller—an homage to Bremont’s military design roots.

Completing the timepiece is a newly developed 904L stainless steel bracelet with a brushed finish. Designed with quick-release functionality and curved bars for improved flexibility, it ensures a seamless fit and exceptional wearing comfort.
The <strong>Altitude Chronograph GMT</strong> is more than a pilot’s tool—it’s a symbol of precision, performance, and enduring craftsmanship.

      <strong>Bremont Altitude MB Meteor - Precision Engineered for Those Who Push Limits</strong>
Introducing the Altitude MB Meteor — the most advanced evolution of Bremont’s legendary MB series. Inspired by the Gloster Meteor, Britain’s first jet fighter and the aircraft used in Martin-Baker’s inaugural live ejection test in 1946, this timepiece pays homage to aviation history while showcasing cutting-edge watchmaking.

Crafted from lightweight yet ultra-durable Grade 2 titanium, the 42mm Trip-Tick® case has been thoughtfully refined with a slimmer profile and shortened lug-to-lug length for enhanced comfort and wearability. Bremont’s upgraded dual-crown system ensures seamless control — with the 2 o’clock crown for setting and winding, and the 4 o’clock crown operating the re-engineered bi-directional Roto-Click inner bezel, delivering a smooth, tactile, and precise rotation.

The cockpit-inspired dial is built for clarity, featuring applied Super-LumiNova® indexes and subtle stencilled detailing. A hallmark of the MB design, the signature ‘lollipop’ seconds hand with its striped ‘ejection’ pull handle counterweight remains — a bold nod to its aviation roots.

At its core lies the robust BB14 automatic movement with an impressive 68-hour power reserve. Suspended in a shock-absorbing rubber mount, it offers superior resistance to impacts. The exhibition case back reveals the finely finished movement, complete with gunmetal grey tones and Geneva Stripes, while retaining anti-magnetic protection via an integrated soft iron ring based on Faraday cage principles.

Completing the piece is a newly designed titanium bracelet, brushed for a sleek finish and equipped with a quick-release system. Curved connecting bars provide fluid articulation and optimal comfort on the wrist.

The <strong>Altitude MB Meteor</strong> embodies innovation, resilience, and heritage — purpose-built for those who live to test the limits.
